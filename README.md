# Voronoi-Diagram-with-pygame-for-Football-pitch
Voronoi Diagram analysis of a football match with pyhame
I split the field control plots with voronoi analysis of the distribution of football players on the field in a football match . 
Than I used the voronoi diagram with pygame codes to prepare in 2d format of the short section of the match.
Football Pitch lines and dimentions have been calculated and plotted according to real pitch size.
Voronoi  lines were calculated according players distributions on pitch.
Colorized areas means that team players more effective in which field

# Dataset of Tracking Data
I have used a tracking data csv which contains coordinate informations of football players and ball based on time for this python file.
I colud not share all file because of file size limits. I shared only a section of csv tracking dataset.
CSV index lines were created based on time (seconds). CSV Columns contain for each player and ball x and y coordinates informatin.
